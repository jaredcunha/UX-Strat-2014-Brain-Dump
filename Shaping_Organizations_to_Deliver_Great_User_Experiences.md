Even with a great strategy and practicing good design, the ultimate outcome is crappy. Why? Oh right. "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."

## Project based, organized by function
Pros - strong design community, wide rante of projects, design costs are understood.
Cons - design is not strategic, little influence on important "upstream" decisions, designers are easily dismissed, __us vs. them__

It's like working as a short order cooking line

## Decentralized and Embedded
Like pods
Pros - Design included throughout the entire lifecycle, part of the team
Cons - One narrow problem for a long period of time, lonely, fractured user experience

There's no overarching consistency for this user experience. 

## Groupon opted different model
Organize for the customer journey. How can you organize your design team to meet this? 

Think in terms in teams. Voltron beats 4 unicorns working in isolation. 

Groupon's design teams:
Mobile, 
Local, Platform (universal stuff), brand design, core merchant, merchant OS, internal tools, goods/getaways, user research, checkout,  [there are more]
Designers work across different design teams and work holistically in a way that was not possible at the organization before.

### Centralized Partnershipo
Best of both worlds
Orgainzed for the customer journey
Deisgn teams maintain a commitment across a meaningful set of products/features
Yet centralization helps maintain a holistic view across the entire customer experience
__side benefit:__ ineveitable re-orgs don't disrupt the customer experience

### Structure of each team
4-7 folks
Singular strong leaderhip
Manages down, up, and across
Best oragnized around business problems, not functions
Spread of skills - strategy, planning, research, IxD, IA, visual design, prototyping

Teams exist at multple levels, some teams are part of larger teams to ensure consistency across platforms and products

## Project Plan
Definition
Initial insight - understand the market - customer empathy - product strategy - ideation - prototype - experience strategty 

- plan - 

Execution
sketch options - prototype solutions - teset prototypes - flesh out solution - user test - refine - build - shop. 
Look up the double the diamomnd. Two phase, go from broad to focus.  Design should make strategy concrete. You have a definition side and an execution side. The execution side needs to be iterated upon. 

It's better to iterate in ideation and prototyping, than in the execution phase.

Methodologyies hinder solutions to ux problems, which are often organizational

## Working with partner teams
Don't understand the 'costs' of design
Don't have control over the ir own destiny
So, lots of coordination and communication

## Maintaining singular leadership
As the designs team grows, having a single leader becomes more difficult
Operational matters trump create matters
Models from tech and journalism
- CTO and VP of Engineering
- Editin-in-chief and Managing Editor

Designers can keep a lot of other people busy. You don't need a lot of designers to keep a lot of engineers busy

With a 1) centralized partnership 2) teams with strong leadership, 3) influencing definition, and 4) a relative small team, __you have leverage__. Leverage is power.  There's no reason design cannot be a driving force. We just need the confidence and evidence to do so. 

Product categories evolve from technology, then you get to feature orientation, and finally, experience. A better experience can trump the number of features. 

We're stuck in a features world when it comes to structuring our product teams.
