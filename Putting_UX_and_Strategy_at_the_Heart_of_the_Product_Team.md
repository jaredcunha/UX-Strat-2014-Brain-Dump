## Experience-focused decision 
There is no such thing as enterprise software anymore. There is just good software and bad software. 
Focus on good experience and design need to be in the DNA of your company culture


## Creating great experiences requires a strong design competency

## Whole organizations and not just designers deliver great products to the market
"There is no such thing as UX Strategy or Design Strategy. There is only Product Strategy"
Product Strategy is drive by product management but only works when UX is in the hearts, minds, and hands of everyone on the team.

IBM Design is now responsible for the product management practice for IBM as a whole. Don't get by just by teaching PMs desgin thinking. 

Design thinking is a way to solve problems. It helps us create great products and services. But it's not that good at delivering them to market. 

## 4 modes of design thinking
Understand 
Explore
Prototype

### Can add "Hills"
"we're going to take that 'hill'". Things happen, and team needs to pivot and handle what's unexpected, perhaps without going up the chain. Can some set the outcome and let the team set out how to achieve it. "A framework for freedom to act"
Example: hills frame the release and planning periods around user-centric market outcomes, not feature requests. A Hill has 3 parts - who, what, wow!. There is no "how". Hills fill the gap between a vision statement and a backlog. It's about getting these things done. 

### Can also add "Sponsor Users"
A set of real users recruited to "join" the product team for a period and do participatory design. Stakeholders will start going crazy for user research. 

### Can add "Playbacks"
The greatest value of a prototype is often how it tells a user's story
The UX for a defined scenario is "played back" to stakeholders to foster collaboration, feedback, and alignment.

__all of this creates a culture of showing versus telling__

### Agile/Lean/DevOps
makes a truly modern iterative approach to creating, delivering, and evaluating quality experiences with market. 
focused on user outcomes for users (see etsy's focus on customer focus)
continuous learning
radical collaboration - get empathy from/for everyone on your team

Fail fast and cheap - figure out how to address the biggest assumptions and hypothesis
