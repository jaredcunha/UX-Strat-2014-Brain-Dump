# Jim Kalbach: Applying 'Jobs to be Done' to UX Strategy
[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/UXSTRAT/ux-strat-2014-jim-kalbach)

Generating more ideas don't help the situation. Designers can exacerbate that. Design thinking activities that don't lead anywhere. 

The job, not the customer is the fundamental unit of analysis for a marketer who hopes to develop products people will buy. 

"People don't want a quarter inch drill, they want a quarter inch hole"

## To be done:
### 1. Understand users
Gather audio, interviews, usability test, etc.

### 2. Map jobs to be done
A mental model helps you visualize how your business strategy look compare to the existing user experience. [Mental models](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/mental-models/) are text-based maps of jobs to be done. 

### 3. Identify opportunities
Read "turn customer input into innovation" article

Create desired outcome statements: "Minimize my effort to find photos on my computer." Seems like user stories. 

Calculate opportunity scores: Importance + Satisfaction Gap = Opportunity Score

### 4. Align efforts

Desired Outcomes as hueristics: does the concept help or hurt? 

Shift language to reflect a job to be done. 

We need to be thinking about arenas instead of market segments.
