[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/UXSTRAT/ux-strat-2014-fabio-sergio-design-for-impact)

## What about societal value as a measure of success? 

For this, you are designing for a community. Not an app, not a user. Designing for people. Design thinking and design doing need to be together. 

## Insights
- Humility
- Emphathy
- Shared Culture
- Community Activation

You don't solve system level problems with just a bunch of guys. 

When the system is sthe experience, the experience is a shared asset. Better have a strategy to choreograph it.

### Societal value vs. busines value
Shared value is what sits at the middle. It can be done. Doing good can be good business.
