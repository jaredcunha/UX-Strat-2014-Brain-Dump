# Laura Granka: Getting a Seat at the Table

Google philosophy - focus on the user and all else will follow. 
UX was all about speed and performance. 

The definition of being user centered at Google had changed over the years, from features to performanceâ€¦

What changed in 2011 for good? 
- Google had a mandate to make everything look good and redesign for consistency. Code name: Kennedy - evolve designa and experience without functional improvements

## Being user centered today

Not purely driven by the metrics and data

Material design - responsive, consistent, and flexible. Multiple inputs. 

UX challenge - organize the world's information and make it presentable to the world. To help people accomplish their goals with technology. 

### When not using data to make decisions

Design is not art. No decisions are arbitrary. It's about finding solutions. 

Product development teams are a mix of engineering, user experience, and product managment. 

#### Building a product
- From ideate, build to launch
__ideate__ - _what do we know already?_ About users and competition
__build__ - _how is it working?_ Iterate and get to the best launchable state
__launch__ - _How did we do?_ Evaulate and track success

#### User centered process
Research, design, prototype (iterate)
Research / Test, Design, Prototype (iterate)

#### User centered approach
Needs, goals, context, end-to-end experience

#### Establish guildelines
Design specs guide icon designs. they are the standard
Use frameworks to provide objective structure

#### Heart metrics
Happiness
Engagement
Adoption
Retention
Task success

##### Happiness
These are moments of delight. They way they talk about their products. They measure the satisfaction through quick user surveys. Find at what point there are shifts in perceptions.

##### Engagement
How much time are spending on the site? What are the reading? What are they sharing?

##### Adoption
The pace of uptake. How quickly are people signing up? Have they reached a plateau? 

##### Retention
It's the toothbrush test? Something you want to do more than once a day. How often are people returning to your product. When are they returning? What's desirable?

##### Task success
Core usability and behavior. Are people able to do what they need to do? 

Data drives insight and inpriration. Combine quantitative and qualitative metrics. 

## The reality of user centered design
It's always messy. You can always have the best intentions for your product lifecycles. Timelines can be too dense. People push back. Understand the tradeoffs. Understand what it means to skip certain phases and when things are not the ideal of what you wanted. 

__Build Trust__ Relationships matter. Establish trust with the product teams. Know technical tradeoffs, understand time required for features. Speak the business language the rest of the teams speak. 

Small groups can make a big difference. Material design was by a small group of designers that wanted to make things happen. It wasn't top down. Understand the needs of all the product teams, when you are able to get buy in from them, it's easier for the executive to sign off on an initiative.
