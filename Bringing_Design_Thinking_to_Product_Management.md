# Jon Kolko: Well Designed: Bringing Design Thinking to Product Management in Order to Create Products People Love
How to use empathy to create products people love

## Where do greate new products come from? 
Is it vision? Companies have a north star of where they are heading. 

## Is it process? 
No playbook for taking a product, turn it to company, turn it into an organization. The speed at which they grow is fragile. 

## Is it hard work?
Blood sweat and tears

Product management unlines the 3 ideas above. 

## Products:
__Establish a vision__, it may come top down. 
__Drive consensus__, never escape the need to drive consensus. There has to be a specific activity to drive people so they are all aligned. 
__Ship product__, this is the hardest part. 

### Product/Market Fit:
Jargon that the market is ready for you.
1. Broad technological / political infrastructure. (uber essentially buying their way into legality)
2. Social precedence. example - google glass. we don't have a precedent for talking to people with computers on their faces… yet. Are people comfortable with the product. It takes time. 
3. Opportunity for Engagement. There has to be engagement, some back and forth with the products you make

### Behavioral Insights
1. Value. Companies provide what they promise. Value proposition needs to be fulfilled. 
2. Identity. People need to see themselves in your product, otherwise it's a commodity. 
3. Provocation. Changes behavior, doesn't conform to behavior. It has opinion. Good products have an opinion. 

## Product Management…
In the engineering world. 
In the design world. 
In the marketing world.

Where is the trend of design in product management coming from? 
Ubiquity of technological products. Technology makes the world strange, design makes it familiar.

Product management is the bridge between deisgn being tactile and strategic. 

To be a good product manager, you need to be a good story teller. It's about wrapping the vision up in a narrative. A story of how the world will be if only your idea existed. Be interested, not interesting. Have curiousity about other disciplines. Be affable, work with others and drive consensus. 

## What does a product manage do? 
1. Contextual Research
2. Synthesis and Snesmaking
3. Behovioral Insight
4. Value Prop
5. Feature Definition
6. Launch and usage metrics
7. Iteration and extensions
8. Communication Strategy
9. Community Feedback - make sure you're getting all the communication that touches the user, not just the prodcut.
