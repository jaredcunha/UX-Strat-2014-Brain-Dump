# Matthew Holloway: Design Your Strategy
[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/UXSTRAT/ux-strat-2014-matthew-holloway)

Design and strategy should be multipliers. 

Design is bigger than UX. Every aspect is "designed" or created with intent. 

## But what is design?
Everyone has a different perspective. Lots of attributes: aesthetics, guidelines, specs, innovations, opportunity, specs, creative, attitude, integration, facilitation, etc.

## Where can design have impact?
Culture, financial, organizational, planning, prototype, products, talent aquisition

## What are the success metrics?
Success, awards, revenue, talent aquisition, market recognition, customer feedback, aligned metrics, talking points, productivity/growth

## Potential of design
challenges, creditiability, track record, portfolio, transparency, what/how, value creation

## How is strategy defined? 
"The closest thing to a religion that an organization has." 

## Merging Design and Strategy

Have an organizational transformation. 
This changes the culture of the company. CHange KPIs, performance goals, etc

Change human capital management, essentially these are HR tools. 
Found the tools didn't matter, it was the policy that mattered.

Interesting, prototyped strategy. 

With design, a lot of it comes from what you are going to say. You can have a bottom up momentum to talk to executives about that stuff. 

Design the role that you want design to have. Take a step back and see if you can figure out what the role you want in the organization and how would you design that role. 

## Big takeaway
As designers, _we need to build up the credability to particate in strategy_. That is how design does more than design. To bring a chair to the table, but there's a bouncer that can take you and your chair away from that table.
