[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/UXSTRAT/ux-strat-2014-fabio-sergio-design-for-impact-39118896)

It takes a villiage to build UX into an organization. 

The problem (Cabela's): Data rich, explains __what__ happens. Little understanding of __why__ it happens. 

Your leverage decreases every day that you are in an organization. 

Typical Analytics base funnel (moving down):
1. visitors
2. engaged visitors
3. buyers
4. purchase

Alternative is the behavioral Model
- Not a linear process
- There are post-purchase behaviors, all of which are important. 

"Shopping trips are like hunting trips. You identify prey. You track it down. You kill it. You show it to your friends"

Shopping is not a linear process. Uncover other roles int he shopping process. All behaviors are important to support. 

Let customers become the megaphone of the brand and allow them to market to each other. 

## Strategic value of behavioral model
Develop a framework to look across customer touch points. 
Create a lens to evaluate existing site structure
Use a foundatiton for tradition user research techniques

You can go into reseach with a set of assumptions or acting as if you know nothing. A set of assumptions helps guide a contextual inquiry. 

Use actionable personas. How does Hal __discover__ what to buy?

Use a foundation for journey mapping.
