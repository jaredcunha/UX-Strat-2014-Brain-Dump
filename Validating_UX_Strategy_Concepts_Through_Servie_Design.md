# Ashley Halsey Hemingway -  Validating UX Strategy Concepts Through Service Design

Bring your own seat to the table, don't wait for one. 

"Start helping strategy level problems __without watiting to be asked__"

## What should a UX Strategy document look like? 
- Could start with simple bulleted list, but you cannot present that to a higher-level staff

Terminology shapes perceptions. Make it considered. You have to communicate the worlk you do well. Otherwise, they will not matter. Think about stakeholders like you would a user. What are their worst nightmares? 

Product is never going to come to UX to request that their problems are solved. UX needs to articulate problems to stakeholders and why it needs their attention.

You can't have a recommendation without a plan. 

Can create a UX opportunity backlog, don't need actionable plan at the moment. Can be addressed when and as necessary. 

Make ideas and recommendations publicly available, even if they aren't being listened to right now. Share the plan with people who can help and have them contribute their ideas as well. 

UX can __bring our own seat to the table__ by starting to make __investable recommendations__. 

Be proactive in bring recommendations. Don't wait. This puts the decision on them.
