# Dan Klyn: Strategy and Structure - Doing It Right, and How You'd Know

"What is good structure? There is not right way, but there is a good way"  -Richard Saul Wurman

Sometimes a difference in scale mean a difference in kind. 

When you have your intention, how do you control what you mean? 

Getting towards good structure is controlling your meaning. 
Information architects are the ones "who maintain control of the meaning"
IA is the structured meaning of information across contexts

## Dumb models
Give your clients dumb models - low fidelity prototypes. With the low fidelity, you are making an argument with how the parts fit together. What it is. It's how strategy and structure come together independt of UI. 

Talk about structures as a duality. The structure works towards what you are doing. Making it a certain way however means you can do certain things with them. 

Duck vs. Decorated shed

With ducks:
If the strategy changes, the structure doesn't lend itself. 

This is a choice you have to make. If your strategy is something you can stay with for the long term, it makes sure to tailor your structure to it. Virgin's booking would not support renting cars. But some sites use the same UI for booking cars and flights.
