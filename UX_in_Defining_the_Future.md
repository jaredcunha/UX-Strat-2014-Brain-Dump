[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/UXSTRAT/ux-strat-2014-theo-forbath)

## How businesses view the evoltion of tech and its impact on brands, products, personal data
We're going from a world of things to a world of smart, connected, programmable things. 

### 3 waves
#### 1. Impersonal computing - basic computing, unconnected pc w/ mouse. 
Personal data was pretty basic - email, passwords

#### 2. Personal computing - about being mobile and always on. we are here
Personal data is now about social graphs, phone numbers, friends, photos, app. It knows who we are, what we like and what we dislike

#### 3. Dematerialization of proccesses
What are they doing around mobile payments? While the rest of the world uses mobile, we don't have it here because we're not comfortable with it. The user experience is terrible. That will change.
Technology is diffusing into everything we do. It's being democratized. 

Example - Doctor in africa built and 3D printed a prosthetic hand for his son and put it in the cloud for anyone to download for $10

Example - WordLens

Example - Airwaves connected masked. Has a sensor that analyzes particles in the air, connects to cloud, provides data where the safest parts of the city.
